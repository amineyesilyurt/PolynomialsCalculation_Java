# Polynomials Calculation Java

A Java class that represents a polynomial

**Definition:** This is a class that represents a polynomial equations Polynomial
represents a polynomial from algebra:
e.g. 4x^3 + 3x^2 - 5x + 2 Class will
keep the coefficients of the polynomial which are double

Polynomial class will keep the coefficients (ai, i=0...n) of the polynomial.
 
• It can take a double array to set all of the coefficients.

• It can return a double array that contains all of the coefficients.

• It can set and get each coefficient separately.

• Given an x value, it can evaluate the polynomial and return the result

• It has methods that take another Polynomial and adds/substracts/multiplies with this 
polynomial and returns the result

• Redefines the toString and equals methods
